# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavel40

Alright, let me introduce myself - my name is Pavel, and Iâ€™m a programmer and web designer (or at least I think I am).

## About me

I am a programmer, web designer, and ðŸŽ® game developer. Or at least I'm doing my best to be one. I like to explore new things, practice coding and play computer games.

If, for whatever reason, you want to know what is my favorite computer game and what is my favorite ðŸ“– book, I can tell you I really like The Witcher books and games.

### Favorite technologies
+ **Python 3** - my favorite programming language
+ **Tailwind CSS** - my favorite CSS framework
+ **Godot engine** - my favorite game engine

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavel40

Alright, let me introduce myself - my name is Pavel, and Iâ€™m a programmer and web designer (or at least I think I am).

My personal website: [pavel40.github.io](https://www.pavel40.github.io)

## About me

I am a programmer, web designer, and ðŸŽ® game developer. Or at least I'm doing my best to be one. I like to explore new things, practice coding and play computer games.

If, for whatever reason, you want to know what is my favorite computer game and what is my favorite ðŸ“– book, I can tell you I really like The Witcher books and games.

### Favorite technologies
+ **Python 3** - my favorite programming language
+ **Tailwind CSS** - my favorite CSS framework
+ **Godot engine** - my favorite game engine

## Programming

My favorite programming language is **Python 3**. I have some basic knowledge of the Flask microframework, which I can use as backend of web applications. Another option for backend of web apps is **PHP**, of which I know some basics too (but I don't like PHP). I can also create scripts for my websites in vanilla **JavaScript** ES6. I also know a tiny bit of C (and a bit of C++, I'm interested in Arduino, and Internet of Things).

## Web design

I can design and create great looking websites using modern technologies - HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript ES6. I can also use Bootstrap and Bulma framework to build websites really fast. I make responsive websites (the site fits every screen) and I can also enable dark mode.

I am also able to convert PSD (PhotoShop) or XCF (GIMP) files to responsive HTML templates.

## Game developement

Iâ€™m also trying to get into game developement. Iâ€™m not very experienced, really just a beginner. Iâ€™m learning to use Godot Engine, because itâ€™s free and open-source.

If you donâ€™t have anything to do, feel free to check my attempts on games on my itch.io. Theyâ€™re all free, of course.

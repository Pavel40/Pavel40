# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Pavel40

Alright, let me introduce myself - my name is Pavel, and Iâ€™m a programmer and web developer (or at least I think I am).

## About me

I am a programmer, web developer and a bit of a designer, and ðŸŽ® game developer. Or at least I'm doing my best to be one. I like to explore new things, practice coding and play computer games.

If, for whatever reason, you want to know what is my favorite computer game and what is my favorite ðŸ“– book, I can tell you I really like The Witcher books and games.

### Favorite technologies
+ **Python 3** - my favorite programming language
+ **Tailwind CSS** - my favorite CSS framework
+ **Godot engine** - my favorite game engine

## Programming

My favorite programming language is **Python 3**. I have some basic knowledge of the Flask microframework, which I can use as backend of web applications. I also know the **PHP** programming language. When I do backend developement, I use PHP most of the time. I can also create scripts for my websites in vanilla modern **JavaScript** or use the VueJS frontend framework. I also know a tiny bit of C (and a bit of C++, I'm interested in Arduino, and the Internet of Things).

## Web design and template coding

My web design skills are not the best. But I think I am improving them. You can take a look at my personal portfolio as an example of my web design skills.

I am able to do some template coding. I use modern technologies - HTML 5, CSS 3, and modern JavaScript. I can use CSS frameworks Bulma, Bootstrap or TailwindCSS to build websites faster. My templates are responsive, they fit every screen. I can also create templates with dark mode.

## Game developement

Iâ€™m also trying to get into game developement. Iâ€™m not very experienced, really just a beginner. Iâ€™m learning to use Godot Engine, because itâ€™s free and open-source.

If you donâ€™t have anything to do, feel free to check my attempts on games on [my itch.io](https://pavel40.itch.io/). Theyâ€™re all free, of course.
